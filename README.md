Overview of the Project :

Project - STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Objective :
The objective of the project is to create a student management system 
that can handle student registrations, maintain student records, and calculate grades. 
The system should allow adding, editing, and deleting student information.

Key Activities :

Here are the key activities involved in creating a student management system in C++:

1. Class Definition: Define classes for Student, Course, and Grade to represent student information.
2. Registration Module: Create functions to handle student registrations, including data validation and error handling.
3. Record Management: Develop functions to add, edit, and delete student records, including:
    - addStudent()
    - editStudent()
    - deleteStudent()
4. Grade Calculation: Create functions to calculate grades, including:
    - calculateGrades()
    - findStudentIndex()
5. Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle invalid inputs and exceptions.
6. Testing and Debugging: Test the system thoroughly to identify and fix errors.
7. Deployment: Compile and deploy the system for use.

Technologies Used :

1. C++ Programming Laguage - Primary programming language used.
